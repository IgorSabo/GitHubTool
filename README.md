# GitHubTool

User manual

This application is small console connector to GitHub api.

***** Steps to setup: *****
Generate jar file from the project (rename it to ghtool.jar if needed)
Once jar file is generated to a desired location, additional folder called config needs to be created in the same place where jar file is located, and two property files appConfig.properties and displayParametersConfig.properties, need to be copied there.
These files make our application configuration configurable.
Once done, your structure should look like this:

|--config
|   |-- appConfig.properties
|   |-- displayParametersConfig.properties
|
|--GitHubTool.jar

***** Application configuration *****
appConfig.properties file contains following properties:

displayJsonOutput - by setting this value to true we are choosing to view our results in json format, by setting it to false however, 
                    our results will be displayed in more user friendly manner
                    
useCustomDisplayConfig - by setting this value to true(displayJsonOutput needs to be false!!!) we can choose what params we want to view. Consult the displayParametersConfig.properties file for a complete list of all available properties. Setting any value from those to true will result in them being displayed on output, setting them to false will not show them. 

defaultResultsNum - Default number of displayed results
maxThreadCount - max number of threads that are available to be executed per one console command.

displayParametersConfig.properties file contains all information parameters that are available for a repository.

***** Usage examples *****

If a user does not provide parameters after desc command, application will display information about desc command usage.
